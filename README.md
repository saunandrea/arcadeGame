===============================
The game is copy of frogger with the goal the make it across the street to the water without getting hit. Instead of cars we have little bugs.

To play:
1) Download the zip file from GitHub.
2) Unzip the file.
3) Open index.html with your favorite browser and the game will automatically start.
4) Use the arrow keys to navigate the across the street to safety.

Each time you get hit you'll be sent back to home to try again. Infinite lives.
Also each time you make it to the water, the game will restart and a new beetle will be added at a random spot and at a random speed to challenge you a little more. 

Happy playing!

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
